                    <h2>Day 1: The Medina Maze</h2>
                    <p>
                        The bustling streets of the Medina welcomed me with a cacophony
                        of sounds and a kaleidoscope of colors. My first stop was the
                        Jemaa el-Fnaa square, where snake charmers, street performers,
                        and food vendors created an enchanting atmosphere. I wandered
                        through the narrow alleys, getting lost in the labyrinth of
                        shops selling spices, textiles, and ceramics. A friendly
                        shopkeeper, Ahmed, invited me for mint tea, sharing stories of
                        his family and the history of his wares.
